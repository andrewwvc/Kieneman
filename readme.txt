-  The Kineman Project  -

Do you enjoy the thrill of carefully evading an attack in order to set up a devistating counter blow?
Do you find memorising the buttons and timing of combination attacks and move strings to be a tedious waste of time?
Are you unsatisfied throwing out random attacks, not because you are reacting to something skillfully, but simply out of the hope that you'll happen to beat out whatever your opponent does?
Have you ever wished that there existed a game where the action played out like a Hong Kong martial arts film, only with you in control?

If you've had any of the above thoughts, I hope Project Kieneman (working title) offers you something that satisfies.
